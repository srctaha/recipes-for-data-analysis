## General

### Write down your own recipes, share them, collect feedback, and reflect

This exercise, which should in fact be carried out by almost all members of the society, has the following benefits:
* Establishes transparency in your work (a necessary step to earn trust)
* Prevents you from forgetting hard-learned lessons (a necessary step to maintain long term efficiency)
* Provides others with an opportunity to learn from your experience (a necessary step to give back to community)

### Not only write to explain, but also write to _explore_

Do not wait to document until you clarify your problem and have something to show for others.

Use writing as a learning tool. Why? Because writing:
* Forces us to clear our thinking,
* Crystallizes what we do not understand, and
* Opens the way to dialogue with others.

### Embrace README driven analysis

If we start documentation right from the beginning of an engagement and attempt to **record everything in an unstructured format**, we probably end up with a large set of documents, which would make it difficult to digest the content and would even cause the analysis to loose its way during the _recording_ process.

Solution? — README files.

Why? — Because they are concise, easy to read, and _relatively_ easy to create. Besides, we need only _one_ of them for the whole project.

What do we record on them? — As depicted on the following figure, analyses -- iterative or linear -- comprise a sequence of distinct exploration tasks (*Step A, ..., K*), each of which also comprise a sequence of interrelated subtasks (*a1, a2, ...*).

On your README file, record only those distinct exploration tasks without diving deeper into the subtasks and their results.

This whole exercise will help you keep the focus and enable you to articulate your decisions, findings, and actions more easily.

### Keep a journal of case studies

Always document problems that you have worked on.

Keep full accounts of the problems that business teams have faced, step-by-step recreations of the engagements, evaluated solutions and a rough estimates of the created values.

### Start the body of work with a _silly_ hypothesis

At the beginning of an engagement, you might know nothing about the business, nothing about the problem, nothing about the data. Doesn't matter! State a silly hypothesis to test and move forward with the validation.

At worst, you will build momentum in your work and get familiar with the contents, quirks, and limitations of the data that you have to deal with later. At best, you and your client will learn something new in a very short period of time.

### Sit at the table until the very end

Define the deliverables of your work as follows:
1. A logically and numerically sound analysis
2. A short list of *call-to-action* items, each of which is
    + easy-to-understand
    + realistic
    + consistent with the client's existing strategy — *at least to some degree*
3. A seat on the table where
    + proposed *call-to-action* items will be prioritized
    + execution plans will be created
    + execution status will be tracked
    + results will be evaluated

TODO: explain the purpose of (3)

### Aim high while defining your role as an analyst

Say you work for an insurance company, and the property insurance team wants you to take a look at existing policyholder information and publicly available flood risk data to investigate if there are things that they need to reconsider in their operations.

And say you define your deliverable as creating either one of the following:

1. An excel file where each row contains a single policy and associated flood-risk
1. *In addition to 1*, a slide deck reporting details of the analysis and listing *call-to-action* items
1. *In addition to 2*, a web application that enables clients to interactively interact with the findings (for example, a map of policyholder regions and associated risks)
1. *In addition to 3*, proposal of business processes that will complete *call-to-action* items
1. *In addition to 4*, proposal of a new product that is based on the findings of the numerical analyses

What value do you think you would generate under those 5 scenarios if we would run this thought experiment on a thousand similar engagements? — Distribution of generated business values would probably look like this:

Going from *raw data servicing* to *new product proposals*, your value proposition would increase exponentially. Challenges would definitely increase exponentially too, but do not let those challenges define your role.

### Extra

>* Remember that time management is the key.
>* Give presentations, but find a way to spread knowledge more deeply and continuously.
>* Draw your processes and find a way to attach value to every project.
>* Try to stay lean and simple as long as you can.
