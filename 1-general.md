# Recipes for _success_ in data analysis

## General

### Write down your own recipes, share them, collect feedback, and reflect
This exercise, which should in fact be carried out by almost all members of the society, has the following benefits:
* establishes transparency in how you operate
* prevents you from forgetting hard-learned lessons
* provides others with an opportunity to learn from your practices

### Start documentation from the beginning
Do not wait to document until you have something to show for others.

No: `Clarify the problem -> Analyze -> Document`

Yes: `Clarify the problem -> Document -> Analyze`

Why? Because writing:
* Forces us to be clear
* Crystallizes what we do not understand
* Opens the way to dialogue with others

### Embrace README driven analysis
If we start documentation right from the beginning and attempt to **record everything in an unstructured format**, we probably end up with a large number of documents, which would make it difficult to digest the content and would even cause the analysis to loose its way during the _recording_ process.

Solution? — README files.

Why? — Because they are concise, easy to read, and _relatively_ easy to create. Besides, we need only _one_ of them for the whole project.

What do we record on them? — As depicted on the following figure, analyses -- iterative or linear -- comprise a sequence of distinct exploration tasks (*Step A, ..., K*), each of which also comprise a sequence of interrelated subtasks (*a1, a2, ...*).

On your README file, record only those distinct exploration tasks without diving deeper into the subtasks and their results.

This whole exercise will help you maintain your focus and enable you to articulate your decisions, findings and actions more easily.

### Keep a journal of case studies
Always document problems that you have worked on.

Keep full accounts of problems that product and marketing teams have faced within the company including step-by-step recreations of the solutions.

### Start the body of work with a _silly_ hypothesis
At the beginning of an engagement, you might know nothing about the business, nothing about the problem, nothing about the data. Doesn't matter! State a silly hypothesis to test and move forward with the validation.

At worst, you build momentum in your work and get familiar with the contents, quirks, and limitations of the data that you have to deal with later. At best, you and your client learn something new in a very short period of time.

### Sit at the table until the very end
Outputs of a data analyst are:
1. A logically and numerically sound analysis
2. A short list of *call-to-action* items, each of which is
    + easy-to-understand
    + realistic
    + consistent with the client's existing strategy — *at least to some degree*
3. A seat on the table where
    + proposed *call-to-action* items will be prioritized
    + execution plans will be created
    + execution status will be tracked
    + results will be evaluated

### Build a solid writing habit
Data analysts often face with the challenge of demonstrating their sophistication as a communicator.
