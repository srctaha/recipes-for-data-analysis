# Recipes for data analysis: _An attempt to bring structure to an unstructured activity_

According to most sources, data-analysis is a _well-defined_ process in which specialists (data-analysts) *clean, transform, model and question data* for *helping businesses make intelligent decisions*.

Although there is a large body of work — both academic and industrial — addressing *how to deal with data*, there is a lack of documentation addressing the complexity of the overall data-analysis process and providing concrete advice on how to execute effectively.

The lack of documentation leads to large differences in how data-analysts operate and large differences in the effectiveness of those operations, which constitute a major issue both for analysts doing the work and for businesses aiming to benefit from the works of analysts in a consistent way.

This project lists a collection of recipes (*do's and don'ts*) for analysts to make them more effective in their data analysis engagements.

Listed recipes are grouped into the following four categories:
1. [General](https://github.com/srctaha/recipes-for-data-analysis/blob/master/1-general.md)
1. [Software](https://github.com/srctaha/recipes-for-data-analysis/blob/master/2-software.md)
1. [Statistics](https://github.com/srctaha/recipes-for-data-analysis/blob/master/3-statistics.md)
