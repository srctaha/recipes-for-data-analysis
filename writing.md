## Writing

### Build a solid writing habit
Data analysts often face with the challenge of demonstrating their sophistication as a communicator, which requires them to develop advanced writing skills. To achieve effectiveness in writing, book 15~30 min everyday in your calendar and practice.

### Be thoughtful while using jargon and acronyms in your documents
> AGC issues are highly associated with SR churn.

Although such beginnings might be common in presentations and emails reporting analysis findings, and although _some_ clients might not have much difficulty in decoding such abbreviations, it would be wise to spell out terms on their first occurrence.

Please consider _future yourself_ as one of the current clients as well, and prepare documents accordingly.

### Write in a way that your message is _falsifiable_
TODO: Explain

### Adverbs are often _unnecessary_. Get rid of them whenever possible.
> Write with _nouns_ and _verbs_, not with adjectives and adverbs. The adjective hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place. — Strunk and White in "The Elements of Style"

> The adverb is not your friend. — Stephen King in "On Writing"

* Intensifying adverbs such as _rather_, _quite_, _incredibly_, and _extremely_ are mostly pointless, as they do not alter the argument.
* Hedging adverbs such as _almost_, _generally_, _sometimes_, and _usually_ indicate uncertainty, which erodes the credibility of your argument.

There is no need to call a problem _very difficult_. It is either difficult or not. Adding '_very_' to the sentence does not alter the argument.
